# Won't You Be My Neighbor?

## It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a neighborly day to volunteer, would you be my, could you be my, won't you be my neighbor?

### Neighbor is the product of community-oriented developers who grew up asking, “Won’t you be my Neighbor?” Our goal is to create more accessible opportunities to help those in our community through volunteering, offering goods, and engaging in local community projects. If you are in need of help, or want to help, all you need to do is turn to your Neighbor.

### Community members who need an item or service can save money by posting their needs on the app, alerting their nearby Neighbors of an opportunity to help.

### Members can both create and search for local community volunteer opportunities. Localizing volunteership means less competition and no need to wait!
